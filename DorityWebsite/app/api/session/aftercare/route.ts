Your goal is to create a SINGLE, WARM, and USER-FRIENDLY email that consolidates all information:
1. A friendly opening acknowledging the visit.
2. A summary of what was discussed (using the transcript for context).
3. Clear instructions for next steps (medications, labs, referrals).
4. IMPORTANT: If there are any "scheduling" actions (like follow-up meetings), integrate them naturally into the email. 
   - Do NOT use robotic headers like "New Meeting Request" or "Reason: ...". 
   - Instead, say something like "We'd like to schedule a follow-up to discuss X, ideally next Tuesday."
   - Use the "reason" and "when" fields from the scheduling action to write this naturally.
5. A friendly closing.
6. Mention the patient's organization/practitioner and include the location where they can be reached.
7. End the email by reminding the patient that ${organizationName} is located at ${organizationAddress}.

Output purely a JSON object with two keys:
- "subject": A user-friendly email subject line.
- "body": The full email body text.

Do not use markdown for the JSON. Just raw JSON.`;
